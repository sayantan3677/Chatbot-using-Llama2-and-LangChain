# Chatbot-using-Llama2-and-LangChain
Training a Llama2-Powered Chatbot to Interact with documents
The goal of this project is to build a closed-source chatbot on a CPU using the quantized Llama2 model (7B parameters).

The resulting application will be evaluated based on it's ability as a tool of convenience for retrieving information from research papers. More specifically, it will evaluated by the quality of it's responses, the run time, and the memory expenditure.
